# WEBD 5000 - Exercise 18 

##  HTML TABLES REVIEW

###  Tutorial 6 Case Problem 2 (HTML 514)
 
#### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- When satisfied that you have completed all the required changes to the repository folder, **commit & push** the entire folder's contents up to GitHub as shown in class. 
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the exercise.  

####  Important Note #1: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the exercise (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the exercise.  

####  Important Note #2: 

There is some confusion in **Step 11** in the textbook:

1. When they say to hide **the** **thead h1** element in the mobile style, I think they meant that you should hide both the **thead** and the **h1** table elements.

2. The **medium grey** background they suggest for the table caption does not seem to match the example screenshot of the mobile site in the book. Perhaps try a background color of **black** instead.

Also, I followed their instructions but did not quite get the same spacing between the columns on the mobile site as the date was very close to the information in the other column. This is fine for marking purposes although if you play with spacing to fix it (e.g. margin, padding), that is fine as well.

### Tasks:  

Complete Case Problem #2 from Tutorial 6 on page **HTML 514**(Section 6-14g) of the textbook.
